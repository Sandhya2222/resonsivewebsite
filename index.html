            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.
                State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools
                and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81%
                for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18,
                84.7% for male and 70.3% for female. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53%
                and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. India's improved education system is often cited as
                one of the main contributors to its economic development. Much of the progress, especially in higher
                education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrolment in
                higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of
                26.3% in 2019,[14] there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education
                enrolment levels of developed nations, a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to
                continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated
                in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any
                accredited educational institution) and all the other aspects of operation. Hence, the differentiation
                of government schools and private schools can be misleading. However, in a report by Geeta Gandhi
                Kingdon entitled: The emptying of public Schools and growth of private schools in India, it is said that
                For sensible education policy making, it is vital to take account of the changing trends in the size of
                the private and public schooling sectors in India. Ignoring these trends involves the risk of poor
                policies/legislation, with attendant adverse consequences for children’s life chances.
